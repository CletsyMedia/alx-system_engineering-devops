**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (GMT-5) on February 15, 2024.
- **Impact:** The outage affected our cloud-based messaging service, leading to a complete service disruption for approximately 30% of our users. Users experienced inability to send or receive messages during this time, resulting in significant inconvenience.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing an overload on one of the backend servers.

**Timeline:**

- **9:55 AM:** The issue was first detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates for message deliveries.
- **10:00 AM:** Engineers noticed an unusual increase in system resource utilization.
- **10:15 AM:** Investigation began, focusing initially on backend database performance and network connectivity.
- **10:45 AM:** After ruling out database and network issues, attention shifted to load balancer configuration.
- **11:00 AM:** Misleading assumption was made that the issue might be related to database replication lag, leading to a brief diversion in investigation.
- **11:15 AM:** Incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further assistance.
- **11:30 AM:** Root cause identified as load balancer misconfiguration. Configuration was adjusted to distribute traffic evenly across backend servers.
- **11:45 AM:** Service fully restored, and error rates returned to normal levels.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused uneven distribution of traffic, resulting in overload on one of the backend servers. This led to increased error rates and service degradation.
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer configuration to evenly distribute incoming traffic across all backend servers. This ensured optimal resource utilization and prevented overload on any single server.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated load testing procedures to detect configuration errors before deployment.
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly identify and respond to similar issues in the future.
- **Tasks:**
  - Update load balancer configuration to include health checks and automatic failover mechanisms.
  - Conduct regular audits of infrastructure configurations to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.
  - Provide additional training to engineering teams on troubleshooting and incident response procedures.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages occurring in the future and ensure a more robust and resilient messaging service for our users.
