This project, conducted as part of my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX-Africa School, aimed to delve into the intricacies of designing Web Infrastructures. The project involved creating multiple iterations, each building upon the previous one to enhance the complexity and functionality of the web infrastructure.

### 1. 0-simple_web_stack

- **Design:** A Web Infrastructure designed with a LAMP stack, encompassing 1 server, 1 web server, 1 application server, 1 database, and 1 domain name.
- **Components:** Server, Web Server, Application Server, Database, Domain Name.

### 2. 1-distributed_web_infrastructure

- **Design:** An extension of the 0-simple_web_stack, incorporating additional components such as 1 server, 1 web server, 1 application server, 1 load-balancer, 1 set of application files, and 1 database.
- **Components:** Server, Web Server, Application Server, Load Balancer, Application Files, Database.

### 3. 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure

- **Design:** Building upon the 1-distributed_web_infrastructure, this version integrates extra security and monitoring features, including 3 firewalls, 1 SSL certificate, and 3 monitoring clients.
- **Components:** Firewalls, SSL Certificate, Monitoring Clients.

### 4. 3-scale_up

- **Design:** An advanced iteration based on 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure, introducing further scalability with 1 additional server and 1 additional load-balancer.
- **Components:** Server, Load Balancer.
