Welcome to the Networking Basics project! Here, we explore fundamental concepts in computer networking, from the abstract OSI model to practical scripts for network-related tasks. Let's dive into the different topics covered in this project using some cool emojis! 🚀

## 0. OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is like the blueprint for communication in computer networks. 🏗️ It's organized into layers, ranging from the physical transmission layer (layer 1) to application-specific communication (layer 7). Though it's abstract, understanding the OSI model helps unravel complex interactions in networking. In this project, we focus on the Transport (TCP/UDP) and Network (IP/ICMP) layers.

**Questions:**

1. What is the OSI model?
   - Set of specifications for network hardware
   - **Conceptual model characterizing communication functions**
   - Model emphasizing internal structure and technology

2. How is the OSI model organized?
   - Alphabetically
   - **From the lowest to the highest level**
   - Randomly

## 1. Types of Network

Understanding network types is crucial! 🌐 LANs connect local devices, WANs link LANs, and WANs operate over the Internet.

**Questions:**

1. What type of network is a local computer connected to?
   - Internet
   - WAN
   - **LAN**

2. What network connects offices in different buildings?
   - Internet
   - **WAN**
   - LAN

3. When browsing <www.google.com> on your smartphone (not connected to WiFi), what network are you using?
   - **Internet**
   - WAN
   - LAN

## 2. MAC and IP Address

Get to know the unique identifiers of network interfaces - MAC and IP addresses. 🕵️‍♂️

**Questions:**

1. What is a MAC address?
   - Name of a network interface
   - **Unique identifier of a network interface**
   - A network interface

2. What is an IP address?
   - Like a postal address for devices
   - **Unique identifier of a network interface**
   - Number that network devices use to connect

## 3. UDP and TCP

Let's explore UDP and TCP, the dynamic duo of network protocols! 🚀

**Questions:**

1. Correct statement for the TCP box:
   - Transfers data slowly but surely
   - **Transfers data fast with potential data loss**

2. Correct statement for the UDP box:
   - Transfers data slowly but surely
   - **Transfers data fast with potential data loss**

3. Correct statement for the TCP worker:
   - Inquires about received boxes
   - **Requests to increase the sending rate**

## 4. TCP and UDP Ports

Ports are like windows and doors for network devices! 🚪🔒 This script helps you peek at open ports.

## 5. Is the Host on the Network

Use ICMP to check if a network device is online. Ping it 5 times!
Ping an IP address like a pro! 🚀✨

Learning the Networking Basics `#0` project! 🎉 You've explored key networking concepts and even written scripts to interact with networks. Keep diving deeper into the world of networking, and remember, the network is your playground! Happy coding! 🖥️🌐
